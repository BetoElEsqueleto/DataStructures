\subsubsection*{Usage}

Since this project contains mostly libraries, you can just add them to your C++ projects and include them. In some cases, like the \hyperlink{class_dijkstra}{Dijkstra} algorithm, the libraries come with an example to be run with. Since they are standard C++ you can also compile and run. \subsubsection*{What are data structures?}

In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. \+\_\+\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure}{\tt Wikipedia}\+\_\+.

This is the product of a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms.

Basic data structures include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Arrays
\item Lists
\item Dictionaries
\item Queues
\item Stacks
\item Trees
\item Hashes
\item Graphs
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Shortest Path algorithm}

The folder Shortest\+Path contains an implementation of the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm}{\tt Dijkstra algorithm}, used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It reads a file with two strings\+: node 1, and node 2, separated by a blank space between them, and followed by a number; the weight of going from node 1 from node 2. The graph gets saved in an adjacency matrix, which is not at all memory efficient, but was selected as a visualization method for learning the algorithm.

This is a semestral work in progress, so there will be some movement for the next months.
