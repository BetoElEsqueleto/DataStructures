# Data Structures

### Usage
Since this project contains mostly libraries, you can just add them to your C++ projects and include them. In some cases, like the Dijkstra algorithm, the libraries come with an example to be run with. Since they are standard C++ you can also compile and run.
### What are data structures?
In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)_.

This is the product of a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms.

Basic data structures include:
- Arrays
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Queues
- Stacks
- Trees
- Hashes
- Graphs

### Shortest Path algorithm
The folder ShortestPath contains an implementation of the [Dijkstra algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. It reads a file with two strings: node 1, and node 2, separated by a blank space between them, and followed by a number; the weight of going from node 1 from node 2. The graph gets saved in an adjacency matrix, which is not at all memory efficient, but was selected as a visualization method for learning the algorithm.

This is a semestral work in progress, so there will be some movement for the next months.
