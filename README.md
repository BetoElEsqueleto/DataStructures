# Data Structures
### What are data structures?
In computer science, a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)_.

This is the product of a university course on Data Structures and Algorithms.

Basic data structures include:
- Arrays
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Queues
- Stacks
- Trees
- Hashes
- Graphs

### Dijkstra algorithm
The folder ShortestPath contains an implementation of the [Dijkstra algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), used to find the shortest path in a graph.

This is a semestral work in progress, so there will be some movement for the next months.
